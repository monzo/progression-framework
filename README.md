    Progression at Monzo
</h1>

üéâ Welcome to the Progression at Monzo repository

This is where all of Monzo's progression frameworks live, as well as the site that powers `progression.monzo.com` üí™

**Get stuck? There's a glossary at the bottom of this readme!**

## ü§Ø Where am I?

Welcome to GitHub!

GitHub is an online service that we use to store our code, designs, and more. GitHub allows us to manage these files closely, allowing us to track file edits, new file creations, etc. This also means multiple people can work on the same file at the same time! It's pretty neat.

We mainly use GitHub in Engineering, as it allows engineers to review each others code, making sure we have a tidy codebase and (hopefully!) stopping some bugs from crawling through the cracks üêõ

We're using GitHub to store our progression frameworks for a few reasons:
- It's public (or open source), meaning we can share this with the community and allow them to contribute!
- Monzonauts can "own" or manage a framework (or frameworks), meaning they get to control any changes or additions in that area
- It means we can build a super fast site üöÄ

## ‚ùî How does this work?

This is the structure of our repo
```
progression-framework/
    frameworks/
    src/
    CODEOWNERS
    [a bunch of config files]
```

`site` contains our website files, `frameworks` contains our progression framework files, and `CODEOWNERS` is the file that defines who owns or manages a framework, file or folder.
All the other files are configuration, which you should totally ignore üëå

**The `frameworks` folder is what you want to pay attention to!**


This is where all of our progression frameworks live. Head inside, and you'll see folders associated to headlines (like design and engineering).

Inside these folders, you'll see files representing a job (like `designer.md`). 

---

Files that end in `.md` are called Markdown files. We display these files on the site in the same way they are written, so you can put whatever you want  (within reason) in these.

All of these file contain some YAML, which a data format that is similar to a bullet point list. Some of this YAML data is compulsory, as it helps the site build üõ†Ô∏è

Some files contain the compulsory YAML and the rest is Markdown, however some of these files *only* contain YAML.
The files containing only YAML are more structured, and so look a bit different to the Markdown files.

The following YAML data can be found in every file:

``` yaml
path:         ~~ a path goes here, eg "/frameworks/operations/ops-leadership" ~~
title:        ~~ the page title goes here, eg "üéØ Ops Leadership Framework" ~~
sidebarTitle: ~~ this is the title in the sidebar "üéØ Leadership" ~~
sidebarGroup: ~~ this is the subheading/group. eg "operations", or null (for nothing) ~~
yaml:         ~~ indicates if the framework is mainly yaml (true) or markdown (false) ~~
levels:       ~~ the amount of levels you want to be shown if the file is yaml, eg 6 or null (for nothing) ~~
```

If the framework is in YAML format, underneath the compulsory data, you will find something like this:

``` yaml
topics:
  - name: "communication and teamwork"
    title: "üí¨ Communication and Teamwork"
    description: "Description goes here"
    content:
      - level: 1
        criteria:
          - "Clearly articulates what they‚Äôre working on and why."
          - "Gives clear concise updates in team meeting and stand ups on material which is relevant for the team"
      - level: 2
        criteria:
          - "Proactively communicates with stakeholders and tailors communication to audience. Keeps stakeholders like COps, legal, marketing, finance updated on progress and ensures they have what they need."
          - "Gives clear concise updates in cross-team meetings on material which is relevant for the teams"
  - name: "conduct"
    title:
    description:
    content:
      - level: 1
        criteria:
          - "Follows policies and procedures applicable to role. Completes training."
          - "Accepts feedback graciously and acts on it. Gives feedback when requested"
          - "Builds relationships within monzo and contributes to building a supportive, knowledgable and engaged peer group"
        exampleCriteria:
          -  criteria: "A criteria with an example point goes here"
             examples:
               - "The example goes here"
               - "Another example may go here"
```

If a topic's name matches the name of a topic in the generic framework, the generic framework criteria will be loaded as well as your framework criteria, and the title + description will be loaded from the generic framework.
If you have a custom topic, you must define a title and description.
You can see this in the example above, with both the custom "communication and teamwork" topic and the generic "conduct" topic.

For each topic, you must define its contents. This is made up of an object (starts with a bullet point) which contains the criteria, and the level it is associated with.
You can also add examples, by putting them in the `exampleCriteria` object, defining the actual criteria point, and any examples it links to.

If you need any help and are a Monzonaut, ping @lucas a message or put a message in #org-scaling. Otherwise, feel free to raise an issue here in GitHub.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How do I edit a framework?

Firstly, go to the framework file on this site. Click on the ‚úèÔ∏è icon in the top bar, and make your edits in the text editor that appears.

To save or 'commit' your changes, add an overview title and a basic description of what you've changed. You'll see that the option "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" is pre-selected for you.

This will automatically save your changes and open a pull request, allowing the person who manages that framework to comment on your suggestion, decline the suggestion, or approve and merge it to make it live.


## Glossary

**Repository (Repo)**: A folder in GitHub where files live

*If you've seen the word 'repo', we're probably talking about the Progression Framework folder in GitHub that you're on right now (https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework)*

**Pull Request (PR)**: A request to change a file, or multiple files on GitHub

*This will be part of how a framework is changed or created. Normally, someone will 'review' this request (make sure it's good to go live)*

**Squash and Merge (Merge)**: Taking new or modified files, and putting them live

*This is what will happen after somebody has a successful review on their pull request. It'll take the modified files, and put them into the "master" version of the repo, which is what's on our site*

Check out the original data framework [here](https://eng-progression.monzo.com/framework/data/).

## Level 1
### Mastery
- **Technical knowledge:** 

	- Comfortable with using git and contributing to our code base

	- Can extend existing data models and design simple new ones

	- Creates new Looker views and dashboards; extracts basic insights quickly from existing Looker explores

	- Strong SQL skills

	- Implements basic prediction models quickly

	- Basic Python or R skills

- **Stats & Math:**

	- Basic stats and math knowledge

      > **Example**
      >
      > Able to find a formula to calculate confidence intervals for different measurement scenarios, knows how to interpret those etc.

      > **Example**
      >
      > Question from business “Why do salaried users cost us twice as much on customer support?” → cost are allocated by number of intercom queries → salaried users must be generating more queries → Is of queries proportional to engagement? → Are all salaried users are over-proportionally struggling with particular problems (e.g. missing bank statements) → etc.

## Level 2

- Brings things to completion
    
    > **Example 1**
    >
    > analysts/data scientists often exhibit a behaviour where they run many analyses in parallel for a prolonged time without closing tasks off. Closing a task off could mean writing down key takeaway and sharing the findings with the relevant audience.
    
    > **Example 2**
    >
    > brings a model into a production experiment instead of continuing to tweak offline results

### Mastery (Data Science)

- Gives feedback to peers when asked

- Provides helpful and actionable feedback in code reviews in an empathetic manner

- Writes PR descriptions that provide context and provide rationale for significant decisions

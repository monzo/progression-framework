    > **Example 1**
    >
    > Network request lifecycle and authorisation

    > **Example 2**
    >
    > Model layer and persistence

    > **Example 3**
    >
    > App navigation and coordination, eg deep links

    > **Example 4**
    >
    > Modularisation
- Debugs complex problems across a variety of subject areas
  - *Seeks out technical knowledge to compliment their own, researches and patches third party libraries where needed. Uses reasoning to debug and find the root cause of issues. Articulates problem and proposed solution to both technical and non technical peers.*
